### How They Happen
A tsunami is a series of waves generated in an ocean or other body of water by a disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite impact. ... Undersea landslides, which can be caused by large earthquakes, can also cause tsunami waves to form as water attempts to find a stable position.

Most waves form due to winds or tides, but tsunamis have a different cause altogether. A tsunami is most often formed by an earthquake, but it can also be formed by an underwater landslide, volcano eruption or even meteorite.

### History of Tsunamis
While Japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis, the sheer destruction caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times, killing around 230,000 people. The Sumatran region is also accustomed to tsunamis, with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island.

Tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Europe. Of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami (which was caused by the Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault), the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes, each causing several tens of thousands of deaths and the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern Europe. The  Slide in the Norwegian Sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the British Isles refer to landslide and tsunamis predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves.

A colossal earthquake with a magnitude between 9.1 and 9.3 shook Indonesia and killed an estimated 230,000 people, most due to the tsunami and the lack of aid afterward, coupled with deviating and unsanitary conditions. The quake was named the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, and the tsunami has become known as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Those waves traveled the globe – as far as Nova Scotia and Peru.

### Communities Affected by Tsunamis
Massive costs hit communities and nations when a tsunami happens. Victims and survivors of the tsunami need immediate help from rescue teams.

Governments around the world may help with the cost of bringing aid to devastated areas. National institutions, the United Nations, other international organizations, community groups  and a variety of other entities come together to provide different kinds of aid and services. There might also be appeals and donations from people who have seen pictures of the area in the media.

Reconstruction and clean up after a tsunami is a huge cost problem. Infrastructure must be replaced, unsafe buildings demolished and rubbish cleared. Loss of income in the local economy and future losses from the destruction of infrastructure will be a problem for some time to come.

The total financial cost of the tsunami could be millions or even billions of dollars of damage to coastal structures and habitats. It is difficult to put an exact figure on the monetary cost but the cost may represent an important share of a nation's GDP.

After a tsunami, contaminated water and food supplies pose a risk to people's health. Flood waters can carry many sources of contamination such as dirt or oil. In addition, infectious diseases increase after a tsunami. Malaria and cholera may become more common. People may have to stay in shelters or other close quarters that make spreading diseases easier.

Tsunami dangers are difficult to detect far out at sea, since waves do not begin to gain size until they reach shallower waters. As a result, they strike with very little warning, often resulting in a huge loss of human life. The tsunami that struck northern Japan after an offshore earthquake on March 11, 2011, killed at least 14,340 people, which crushed buildings and left thousands trapped under debris or pulled out to sea.

When disaster strikes, UNICEF is always among those first on the ground and the last to leave. This unprecedented catastrophe was no different. In the immediate aftermath, UNICEF teams worked on the frontline in eight countries — Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, India and Somalia — delivering safe drinking water to protect children and their families from deadly water-borne diseases. 

Simultaneously, UNICEF set about providing sustainable solutions to the water crisis that would have a long term impact. In the neighboring town, Lambaro a water treatment plant that had escaped the tsunami's destruction was found suitable for rehab. Though it had fallen into disrepair, UNICEF and Indonesian engineers were able to get it back up and running. 

“We worked day and night around the clock,” says TeukuNovizalAyub, the former director of the plant, which inevitably provided water for around 100,000 shell-shocked survivors who were living in camps in and around Banda Aceh. “We tried to make sure that the work we did create a sustainable resource so that it would continue to provide clean water for as long as possible,” says Mr Ayub.

Those improvements live on. Today, the plant at Lambaro continues to serve the people of Banda Aceh. When disaster strikes, UNICEF is always among those first on the ground and the last to leave.
